What is MATCEM
--------------
**MATCEM** is a MATLAB toolbox for the generation of stationary Gaussian random field using the circulant embedding method [#f1]_. This toolbox can generate either unconditional or conditional random field. See [#f2]_ for more details on the conditional random field generation.
