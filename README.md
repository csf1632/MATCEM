MATCEM
======

What is MATCEM
--------------
**MATCEM** is a MATLAB toolbox for the generation of stationary Gaussian random field using the circulant embedding method [1]. 
This toolbox can generate only unconditional random field. 

Download 
--------
git clone git@github.com:parkmh/MATCEM.git

Example Programs
----------------
Run ex01.m file in an *example* folder.
